/Users/mitchell/git/DjangoPractice/django_test/storage.db
# This is the location of my sqlite3 database.

# Let's Make An App:
python manage.py startapp [app name]
python manage.py startapp article

# This is what my django database line in settings.py looks like:
'NAME': os.path.join('/Users/mitchell/git/DjangoPractice/django_test/', 'storage.db')

cd /Users/mitchell/git/DjangoPractice/django_test

# Create the database:
python manage.py syncdb

# superuser password: kernel

# SQLite Database Browser
# SQLite Professional Read-Only

# Make sure that you add "articles" in your "INSTALLED_APPS" array in your
# settings.py. "articles" is the name of your app.

# If you don't have permissions to create tables through django, 

python manage.py sql [app name]
python manage.py sql article

# you will get a print out like this:
BEGIN;
CREATE TABLE "article_article" (
    "id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "title" varchar(200) NOT NULL,
    "body" text NOT NULL,
    "pub_date" datetime NOT NULL,
    "likes" integer NOT NULL
)
;

COMMIT;

# which you can copy and paste as you need to a different terminal where you
# DO have access to the database.

# If you decide that you're going to change the article model, and/or any of
# the fields within it, take note:
# It's difficult to change stuff BEFORE you insert "articles" in
# "INSTALLED_APPS" in models.py
